Like a bear stocks up on food and then hibernates, a web cracker must stock up on proxies, and then hack until they run out.Web crackers are a distinct breed, and many do not comfort well with the draconian measures that many other crackers take, such as port and service scanning, the modern web cracker finds such tactics much too intrusive. This leaves the web cracker with the only viable option to come in contact with a large number of proxies being to use public proxy lists. These are of course very slow, and very very unstable, and do not allow the cracker much time between his proxy runs.Luckily google gives them another option, if they are smart enough to find it.CGI-proxy ( http://www.jmarshall.com/tools/cgiproxy/ ) is a CGI-based proxy application. It runs on a web server, and acts as an http proxy, in CGI form. A prudent site owner would hide it behind .htaccess, as most do, but with a powerful tool like google, the inprudent few who leave it open can quickly be seperated from the wise masses.CGI-proxy's default page contains the text, as you can see in the demo on their site:\"Start browsing through this CGI-based proxy by entering a URL below. Only HTTP and FTP URLs are supported. Not all functions will work (e.g. some JavaScript), but most pages will be fine.\"The proxy as it resides on a server is most often called nph-proxy.cgi.

Providing a relative path (from the document repository) in the \"pathext\" variable will cause FileManager to provide a directory listing of that diretory. Selecting a file in that listing, or putting a file name in the \"view\" variable, will cause EasyWeb to load the file specified. Only files and directories which can be read by the system user running PHP can be retrieved.Assuming PostNuke is installed at the root level:/etc directory listing:/index.php?module=ew_filemanager&type=admin&func=manager&pathext=../../../etc/etc/passwd file:/index.php?module=ew_filemanager&type=admin&func=manager&pathext=../../../etc/&view=passwdFix/Workaround:Use another file manager module for PostNuke, as the authors do not appear to bemaintaining EW FileManager.Vendor Status: Vendor was contacted but did not respond.Credir: Sullo - cirt.netNOTE: mitigating factor, an attacker needs to be registred and logged on to have access rights to this module."}, {"dork": "allinurl:\"index.php\" \"site=sglinks\"", "description": "Easyins Stadtportal v4 is a German Content Management System for cities and regions.

'intext:\"httpfileserver 2.3\"' will report web pages with the string\r\n\"httpfileserver 2.3\" in its body. This is a feature that Thapa (2016)\r\nidentified in Rejetto.com (n.d.)'s HTTP File Server.\r\n3. '-intext:\"remote\"' will \"filter out\" web pages with the string\r\n\"remote\" in its body. I have identified this string as a feature of\r\nsecurity bulletins reporting on the Rejetto.com (n.d.)'s HTTP File\r\nServer vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThe \"AND\" boolean operator is used to narrow down the search results and\r\ndecrease the rate of false positives.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n----------\r\nRejetto.com (n.d.).
